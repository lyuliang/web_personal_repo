Qian Wang:
The information on the website is quiet straight forward. Nevertheless, I think the designer could improve the interface by formatting the font (make it all same size, same font style and align) and use colors consciously and harmoniously.

Junjie Wang:
The background does not look so good. I suggest you use a more dark and simple background.

Zhengyu Sun:
The design of these user interfaces looks clear, clean and user-friendly. It may be better if the background color can be brighter.

Ziyi Yan:
Color combination can be more consistent and the background is a little bit distracting.

Zhe Chen:
The interface is simple but fully functional

Daren Zheng:  
Great job on the layout design! I really appreciate this wireframe design. Here are some of my personal advices.  For the login and registration pages, it could be better to leave more space for the future design. The current content is limited, but the main container takes a large space of the page. As for the pages of profile and global stream, I would suggest to select a similar color of the buttons and navigation bar, which constitute a more uniform style. Additionally, I think it might be a plus if the navigation bar is composed of some functional buttons(e.g. to log out), or a drop-down menu.

Haozhe Wang:
1. Background is too ugly, recommend to change to a simpler one.
2. On the login and sign up page, "submit" button is missing.
3. Move the profile to the right, which is closer to the button "view my profile" is better

Yanqing Wang:
1. Personally, I think the contrast between the black body of your webpage and the white border may be too strong. I suggest that you change the color of the body to a softer one.
2. In the login page, maybe you could add a button to control the visualization of the password (i.e. make the password switch between hidden and visualized).
3. Typically, I think a website may contain some website information (e.g. copyright information), which may be contained in the footer or sidebar. I think maybe you could arrange a place to display those info.
4. In the Profile page, I don’t consider the field of ‘Firstname’ and ‘Lastname’ to be useful, since the upper whole name contains the information. In my opinion, it may be more appropriate to replace those two fileds with some other information of the information, such as birthday, username, hobbies, etc.
5. Maybe in Global Stream page, you should place the ‘View my Profile’ tag at the same position as it is in Profile page. I just don’t think the same tag should appear at differnet places in the same website.

Yixin Bao:
I suggest you choose more unified fonts, which would make the UI less disordered.
