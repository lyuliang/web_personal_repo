These are the static pages of a nano-blogging site, ​grumblr​.

Source files include:
1. login.html:
	login​ page; displays a form to the user requesting username and password, linking to the registration page if the user wants to register instead.
2. signup.html
	registration​ page; displays a form requesting a username, first name, last name, and password (with a password confirmation field).
3. global.html
	global stream​ page; lists posts from all users.
4. profile.html
​    profile​ page for a user; shows information about a user as well as all posts from that user.	

The features of this site include the following:
1. Non-logged-in, non-registered users may register for the site. New users must provide a username, first name, last name, and password. Registering for the site leaves the user logged in as the newly-registered user.
2. Registered users may log in using their username and password.
3. Logged-in users are able to post a short (42 characters or less) message. Posts, when
displayed, show the following information:
	the contents of the post,
	the user who posted it (linking to the user’s profile), and
	the date and time the post was written.
4. Logged-in users may view a 'global stream', displaying all posts that have been posted in
reverse-chronological order (most recent first).
5. Logged-in users may view profiles of other users (or their own profiles) when clicking on links
provided with posted messages in the global stream. Profile pages contain information about a user (e.g. first name and last name) as well as all of the posts that user has made, in reverse-chronological order.
6. Logged-in users are able to log out.

Note:
This is not a completed version of the website, but just a combination of 4 static html pages. More features will be developed in the future.
