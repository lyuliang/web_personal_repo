### Incremental development using Git (10/10)

### Fulfilling the grumblr specification (20/20)

### Proper input validation (12/20)
-8 (-4 once or twice, -8 if pervasive) Your application does not check for missing request parameters

### Request routing and configuration in Django (10/10)
-0.1, You should modularize your Django projects by using application-specific `urls.py` files in each application directory, and use your project-wide `urls.py` file to include each application's routes.

### Appropriate use of web application technologies in the Django framework (40/40)

### Design
-0.1 You do need separate django applications for "user", "posts", and "home". With one application you can handle everything you need for this assignment. You should follow the directory structure as specified in the homework write up. There's no deduction this time but avoid doing this for the future homeworks!
